#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is like the skeletal mock-up of the way you would like a system to look in terms of design. This means that it is just a group of images, no HTML or CSS or code components.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing is great because it allows you to plan out your system's design before you program the code into the file. It allows you to make sure you like the way the system will look when it is finished, and it also gives you a way of planning out the code that you will eventually write to program into the system. It makes it easier to do everything, and its really easy to do multiple drafts. 

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I absolutely loved wireframing my site!! I love design so this is something I'm really interested in user experience too, so I was thinking a lot about that while I was wireframing my site. I hope that this is something we are able to really go into at Dev. 

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
Yes, I made many changes as I went through my wireframe mockup for my site. After I created my blog page, I even went back and tweaked my homepage because I came up with more ideas and inspiration when I was making my blog page! It was so fun. 

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
During this challenge, I really thought a lot about which tools and programs I should use to wireframe. I played with a few programs before I decided to use the website: MockFlow. MockFlow is a great tool and I highly reccomend it. There are endless tools that it gives you to create the perfect site or app! I used the internet, my own research, and links from the articles linked on the challenge on Canvas. 

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I honestly loved this challenge. Even though some people probably find design tedious, I could spend hours making wireframes. It's never finished, just like when you are creating a piece of art or writing something. Its so fun!
