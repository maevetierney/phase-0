#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The six phases of web design are as follows:
1.Information Gathering
2.Planning
3.Design
4.Development
5.Testing and Delivery
6.Maintenance

#What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
People who come to my site will be looking to find content about me perhaps because they are trying to hire me for a job. The site will be a way that people in tech can see that I know how to create a user friendly website that also conveys information about me and my work to visitors. My site's purpose is to get me hired and noticed.

#What kind of content will your site feature?
People who come to my site will be looking to find content about me. This may include photos of me, ways to contact me, examples of my work or projects, my blog posts about my life and work and interests, as well as information about me and my background.

#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience will be people who are looking to hire me for a job. Their interests will be regarding evaluating my work and my background to see if I am a potential candidate for the position. My site will offer all of the information for these people based on my content pages.

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
When a user visits my site, I would like them to do all of these things, see my portfolio, my contact information, my blog posts about my life, work and interests, as well as my background information. They can search for information easily, but this site will be extremely user friendly in the sense that it will be very easy to navigate to find all of this information.

#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
I think the main thing people should know about design and user-experience is that they are different, not interchangable, but they work together to create a user-friendly and efficent website. User experience is different than it used to be because now we think about more than what looks good to the client, we think about what the user. Usability is different than user experience because UX is about how a visitor feels when they use a system, and usability is about being user friendly and efficent in it's interface.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User Experience design is important because it is centered around the user and their feelings when they use a system. This is very important in web design and development because it can change the way a system is tailored and presented. Designers need to think about user experience, and not just their client, because users visiting and using the system in a positive manner is what makes a sytem succesful.

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found trying to understand the difference in the evolution of user experience design tedious, because i don't really understand how designers never really thought about the user and their feelings towards a system before, it is very important for success!
