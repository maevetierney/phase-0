<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was super fun! I definitley was a little more rusty than my partner, so it was great having a peer doing it at the same time so we could share info and help each other out. It is very rewarding to build something and see it come alive in all its glory.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fine, I definetley needed to reseach to refresh my memory about formatting a web page and what not. There are endless recourses out there. 
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did okay. It was definitley challengeing because i felt like i didnt even know where to start writing. Having a peer giving me small pieces of reasurance was very helpful.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Html seems like a skeleton to me. So it's not as fun as all of the other languages that go on top of HTML to make it pretty and fun and intereactive. But without the skeleton, the page wouldnt be the same, its the true backbone. Its also very easy to use, which is cool because anyone can learn it. 
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
For remembering to write HTML, I like to refresh my memory by glancing at another webpages beginning format. I tend to forget <DOCTYPE! html> and to close important <> at the end.
