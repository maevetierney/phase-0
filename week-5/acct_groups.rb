# ------------------------
#In this challenge, you will make your own method to 
# automatically create accountability groups from a list 
# of names. You'll want to make of the People in your cohort. 
# Try to get everyone into an accountability group of 4 or 5. 
# Be sure everyone is in a group of at least 3 -- 
# It's no fun if someone is in a group by themself or 
# with one other person. 

#Psuedocode----------------
# => Input 
	# => List of names of people in Sea Lions Cohort
# => Output 
	# => List / groups of 4 or 5, at least 3 ppl min 
# => Steps
	# => def acct_group(list_of_names)
	# =>  => list of names - array
			# => number of names in string divided by minimum of 3
			# => and max of 5 into smaller grouped arrays 
			# => return the smaller group of arrays
# => -----------------------
#Solution 

def acct_groups(list_of_names)
  list_of_names.each_slice(5) do |slice| 
      p slice
  end
end

# Reflection
# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# => I liked this challenge. It was a good way to practice iterating over an array and outputing something 
# => different. The most difficult part for me was deciding how to iterate over the array and deciding
# => what method to use.

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# => Yes I feel as though I am improving in my ability to write psuedocode and break the problem down. 
# => I am finding myself spending more and more time on really really thinking about what kind of methods and 
# => techniques I want to use to get to my solution. I am also finding that researching on the Ruby Docs 
# => and the Rubyist book, to examine all of my options of finding the most reliable path to finding the solution. 

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
# => Yes I think the approach that I used was definitley a very straightforward path. I used the .each_slice
# => method to iterate over the array to separate them into groups of 5, assuming that would be the max
# => amount of people in each group. The number came out perfectly giving the last group 3 people. 

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# => I decided to use the array data structure because this was a list already set up like an array and I knew that
# =>  I could have separated them into key value pairs in a hash, but I had a feeling .each_slice might 
# => just be easier if it gave me the perfect result- which it did. The hash method would have been useful in 
# => that I could have separated 5 names max, 3 min, and gave them values of a group number. 

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# => In the process of refactoring I used irb to test my code out. It was very useful in that all i had to do 
# => was put the list in and then call my one line of code inside the method I was creating. I have never 
# => used .each_slice before, however I have heard of it, so it was interesting to see it in action. It's 
# => very useful!
