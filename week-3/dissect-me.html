<!-- 
-What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	The tags that i keep returning to are tags like p, h1, h2, etc, and title. These are the ones i am comfortable with because i knew a bit of html before i came to DBC.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	Elements are laid out on a page vertically because i am not sure yet how to really organize various elements. The browser uses inheritance to display style and elements. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	I learned that Sublime is awesome because i can store snippets inside it as a file and easily bring them back into new files so it can save a lot of time. Which is great! Yea i bet i will create more snippets. I definitley will be researching more shortcuts too, im finding that sublime doesn't have to be so tedious as people think coding is, there are lots of tricks to make it more efficent.
