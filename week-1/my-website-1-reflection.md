#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

-To create a repository on GitHub go to your little plus sign icon on the upper right corner of your page. Click new repository. Name it your username. Initialize with a README. Add a liscence. Press create. 
-To clone this repository: 
	- Access the repository that you would like to clone on GitHub.
	- Select the link in the side box titled HTTPS://. Copy it to your clipboard.
	- Open a new window in your terminal.
	- Type “pwd" to make sure you are in the correct user on your computer.
	- Type "git clone” and follow with pasting the link that is in your clipboard that you want to clone.
	- After the terminal clones the new repository, type, “ls” to access the files in this new repository! They are all there, hopefully.
	- If you want to access more folders inside this new repository type “cd” following with the inner folder’s name.

#Describe what open source means.
Open source is a term to describe a way in which software is shared. It is the computer code that a computer understands to run the software. Some people share their software programs, which is called open source. 

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I feel like open source is a good thing. I believe that the internet is a wonderful thing because it allows people to share information and knowledge. It is a method of communication some people use to spread knowledge. Some people though, want to protect their work, and may choose to hide their software code. But I don't believe that there is anything negative about sharing your code with others. Yes, they may take it and use it to make their own software. But is that really that horrible? That's what life is about, sharing informaiton so we can make the world a better place. Open Source enables people to access information that they may not be able to have before, sharing and spreading knowledge. 

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Even though all code in the states is liscence, you should still use a liscence because you may need help editing or fixing your code later. 

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge in particular pulled together the past two challenges for me. The past two challenges were hard in the sense that it was a lot of foreign information to me having had no previous computer science education. I struggled with finding a workflow/step guide in the sense that there were a lot provided to me but sometimes I got the steps mixed up when I was completing the challenge and had to start over becuase I would get lost in my flow. But I made my own workflow step guide and got it down. This challenge made me feel awesome because after practicing tracking changes, playing with the repositories and whatnot I finally breezed through and felt really proud of myself! It's not so hard after all :) 

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I made my own workflow step guide and wrote it down, inspired from the workflow videos.
