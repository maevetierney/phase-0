I learned about meditation, growth mindsets, the pomodoro technique, tiny habits, flow, the Fogg Method and time box. Time boxing is a structured set amount of time allocated to completing a goal. The pomodoro technique is an example of a time box in use designed to manage goals so you do not burn out. I use the pomodoro technique myself. I also meditate everyday because I do yoga every morning. I also understand what the flow is and how it feels to be in the zone like that, but I do have trouble motivating myself sometimes. I am also a procrastinator - my whole life has been a struggle. However I try my best and try to learn from my mistakes. I will continue to employ the new productivity techniques that I just learned about, in addition to continuing the ones that I already use. My overall plan fro phase 0 time management is all based on starting a schedule for the week ahead, allocating challenges and various tasks to each day. I will also practice yoga every morning from 8-9am and follow my practice with my tasks for the day.

A shell is a user interface that connects the user to an operating system. A bash is a type of shell and computer language used with unix. The hardest part about this challenge was really not knowing anything about computers and computer science or programming before I watched this. I don’t know that much about the history of computer science, and its evolution, so it was very interesting for me to learn about unix and the shell. It puts into perspective how much work goes into designing a computer interface.After studying all of the commands I practiced using them with the crash course. It was very helpful in solidifying my understanding of the commands. In my opinion, the most important arguments are: find, cp, less, mv, echo and exit. 

1. print working directory
2. move a file or directory
3. end 
4. enter
5. make a working directory 
6. page through a file 
7. remove a directory
8. remove
9. help

To create a new Repo:
Type in www.github.com/[ ENTER: YOUR USERNAME ] to access your github account. 
At the top right corner of your profile, press the + sign and click “New repository"
This will create a new folder/repository for you. Name it, add a license and click the big green button. 
You did it! 
To fork a repository:
Access the repository on GitHub that you would like to fork. 
Click the fork button on the upper bar. 
Then select the repository that you would like to fork this file into. 
You did it!
To clone a repository:
Access the repository that you would like to clone on GitHub. 
Select the link in the side box titled HTTPS://. Copy it to your clipboard.
Open a new window in your terminal.
Type “pwd" to make sure you are in the correct user on your computer.
Type "git clone” and follow with pasting the link that is in your clipboard that you want to clone. 
After the terminal clones the new repository, type, “ls” to access the files in this new repository! They are all there, hopefully. 
If you want to access more folders inside this new repository type “cd” following with the inner folder’s name. 
What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
Setting up Git Hub was okay but it confused me a lot trying to understand it’s purpose and all of the different files and why they are important. Learning how to create a new one, how to fork and how to clone was really helpful because I now understand the levels of repositories and how you can take them from the internet and put them into your computer.
