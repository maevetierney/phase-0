# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Cyrus Vattes].

# 0. total Pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!

# Input: def total(array)
# Output: array.each do |x|
# Steps to solve the problem.
# => x+=array_numbers
# => return the sum of the numbers

# 1. total initial solution
def total(array)
 	sum = 0
 	array.each do |x|
 		sum+=x 
 	end 
 	return sum 
end 

# 3. total refactored solution

def total(array)
 	sum = 0
 	array.each do |x|
 		sum+=x 
 	end 
 	return sum 
end 

# 4. sentence_maker pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!
# Input: def sentence_maker(sentence)
# Output: sentence.each do |y|
# Steps to solve the problem.
