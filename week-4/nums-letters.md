#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number. A float is a number that has a decimal/fraction. 

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? 
When you use float numbers in programming, the computer writes the answer back to you in float numbers(decimal numbers). This is very accurate. When you ask the computer to divide integers, it will return an answer that is closest(rounding down)using integers. This is interesting because the computer is giving you the closest answer using whole numbers- which can be useful if you are trying to find the answer to a problem where you are only looking to use whole numbers.
